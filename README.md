## Overview
With the dream of starting a bike share business in Des Moines, Iowa, citibike data from New York City was collected and analyzed to see if the business is feasible. Variables like Gender, Trip Duration, Start Time, and Stop Time were used to designed multiple charts and graphs that will drive the decision to begin the business. Using Tableau, dashboards were used to build a Story to present to an angel investor that is interested in the potential business. Kate will use the models in the Tableau Story during her proposal to the investor.
